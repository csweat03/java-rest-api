# Java Rest API

This is a Java Server Application with a functional REST API, this project depends on the following: [junit, slf4j, sparkjava, mongodb, gson]
This application uses SparkJava to create REST API handlers for various implementations such as users and projects.
This also instantiates a connection to a MongoDB Database and talks back and forth to sync data during various steps in the process.
Additionally, I used gson to process configuration input in the config.json file that can be found in the 'resources/json/' directory.
